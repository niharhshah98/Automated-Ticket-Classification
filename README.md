This project, conducted in collaboration with the San Francisco Office of the Controller, focused on addressing inconsistencies in ticket classification within the Municipal Transportation Authority's Enterprise Resource Management (ERM) system. The primary challenge was the inaccurate categorization of tickets into "Incidents" and "Service Requests", which hampered operational efficiency and data reliability.
